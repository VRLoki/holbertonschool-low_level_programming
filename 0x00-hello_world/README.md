# 0x00 - C - Hello, World

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why C programming is awesome
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when I type `gcc main.c`
* What is an entry point
* What is `main`
* How to print text using `printf`, `puts` and `putchar`
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator `sizeof`
* How to compile using `gcc`
* What is the default program name when compiling with `gcc`
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check my code with `betty-style`
* How to find the right header to include in my source code when using a standard library function
* How does the `main` function influence the return value of the program
